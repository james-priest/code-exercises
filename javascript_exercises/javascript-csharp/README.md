# JavaScript Tutorial
This [JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6n9fhu94yhUA99nOsJkKXBqokT3MBK0b) series consists of 75 videos published by Pragim Technologies.

It was published from Oct 2014 thru Oct 2015 and covers JavaScript ES5 in the context of ASP.NET. While JavaScript and it's coding conventions have evolved since this series was released, many of the concepts are still relevant and applicable today.

The section of the series covered here, lessons 53-65, relates to using JavaScript in an object-oriented manner to replicate class-based inheritance. This is the style of JavaScript most commonly promoted by Microsoft for use in developing enterprise-based web application systems.
