# JSLint, JSHint, & ESLint

Installed, configured & tested each of these linters

## JSLint

This is the granddaddy of them all and was originally written by Douglas Crockford in 2002 with the latest stable version released in 2011. It offers no config and is highly opinionated as to what "The Good Parts" are. See [JavaScript: The Good Parts](). Still, this is the staple linter to use if you are just starting out and want to see where it all began. Simple install. No configuration needed.

* performed a global install
  * `npm install -g jslint@latest`

  * `jslint a.js`
* no config or rc file necessary

## JSHint

This linter came about in 2010 and originated from JSLint. It was originally maintained by Crawford who then handed it over to Anton Kovalyov, followed by Mike Sherov. It offers the ability to configure the error checks by turning them on or off.

## ESLint

This is the third linter in the series and was developed in 2013 by Nicholas C. Zakas. It is the most popular and widely used linter and also the most configurable. It allows developers to create their own linting rules and allows three levels of severity for any violation - ERROR, WARN, and INFO
