2. Build a function expression assigned to a findVehicle variable, which accepts name and list parameters for the name of the individual vehicle sought and the full array of vehicles.

4. if the type of the current object in the list matches the name parameter, then return the current objectâ€™s storedAt location.
5. Call the findVehicle function and pass in the correct arguments to find the storage location of the "Submarine".
