/**
 * JavaScript method replacement
 * Each instance has its own properties & methods
 * These props and methods are separate from that of any other object
 * A change in one instance will not affect another instance
 * This is desirable for an object's data but is it desirable for its methods too?
 *
 * NOTE: Any new or updated functions will not be able to access private data in the
 * Vehicle object instance. This is because the new or updated method is executed
 * externally to the initial Vehicle object creation that contained the private data.
 * This private data is 'bound up' in the Vehicle object's closure (lexical environment).
