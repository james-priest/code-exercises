// The anonymous function expression is wrapped in parentheses to tell
// the JavaScript interpreter that the function isn't only being defined;
// it is also being executed when the file is loaded.

// in which Car and Truck are public but vehicleCount, vehicles, and
// repair are private.

// 'var' keyword in the scope of the IIFE creates a private variable
