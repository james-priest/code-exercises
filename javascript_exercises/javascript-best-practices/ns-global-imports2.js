 * Build Import
 * First, import the explorerAnswer global by passing it as a parameter at the very bottom.
 * Then, pass answer as the parameter to the function keyword at the top. 
 * Lastly, replace explorerAnswer with answer inside the local function scope.

// Your import ensures clarity of scope within a module.
// By using a parameter, you protect the global data that might have been overwritten.
// All imported data becomes locally scoped to the anonymous function, to be used in the closure.
// Thus, when compared with searching the entire scope chain, imports are both clearer & faster.
